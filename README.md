This app has been enhanced from the original app in that now it adds a delay of x minutes (where you can enter the minutes in decimal format. Example: 2.5 minutes) after the open/close sensor was opened before unlocking the door. I did this because I want the lock between my house and garage to unlock after the garage door opens, but wanted to add a delay in case of someone getting my garage door opened, they wouldn't immediately be able to get into the house (figure a perpetrator would want immediate access, and if not, would leave).
