# Smart Things - Unlock Door On Open

A smartthings app to unlock a door when an open close sensor is opened.

## Install

1. Log in to the Smart Things Developer IDE
2. My SmartApps > + New SmartApp
3. Select From Code
4. Paste the code from the provided script
5. Save and Publish

With this app created and published for yourself you can now set up a door to unlock on the open state of an open/close sensor. I use this to unlock a lever lock (http://www.kwikset.com/products/details/electronic-locks/912tnl-trl-zw-11p-smt.aspx) that is on a self closing door so that I don't lock myself out. I could just type in the code to get back in but this is what SmartThings is for righ?
